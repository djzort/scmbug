REM PRE-COMMIT HOOK
REM
REM The pre-commit hook is invoked before a Subversion txn is
REM committed.  Subversion runs this hook by invoking a program
REM (script, executable, binary, etc.) named 'pre-commit' (for which
REM this file is a template), with the following ordered arguments:
REM
REM   [1] REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)
REM   [2] TXN-NAME     (the name of the txn about to be committed)
REM
REM The default working directory for the invocation is undefined, so
REM the program should set one explicitly if it cares.
REM
REM If the hook program exits with success, the txn is committed; but
REM if it exits with failure (non-zero), the txn is aborted and no
REM commit takes place.  The hook program can use the 'svnlook'
REM utility to help it examine the txn.
REM
REM On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have 'pre-commit'
REM invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the
REM work itself too.
REM
REM   ***   NOTE: THE HOOK PROGRAM MUST NOT MODIFY THE TXN.    ***
REM   This is why we recommend using the read-only 'svnlook' utility.
REM   In the future, Subversion may enforce the rule that pre-commit
REM   hooks should not modify txns, or else come up with a mechanism
REM   to make it safe to do so (by informing the committing client of
REM   the changes).  However, right now neither mechanism is
REM   implemented, so hook writers just have to be careful.
REM
REM Note that 'pre-commit' must be executable by the user(s) who will
REM invoke it (typically the user httpd runs as), and that user must
REM have filesystem-level permission to access the repository.
REM
REM On a Windows system, you should name the hook program
REM 'pre-commit.bat' or 'pre-commit.exe',
REM but the basic idea is the same.
REM
REM Here is an example hook script, for a Unix /bin/sh interpreter:

set REPOS=%1
set TXN=%2


REM @DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME@_STANZA_START
REM
REM
REM Call the @DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME@ integration glue
"@DEVEL_CONFIG_PERL_BINARY@" -I %REPOS%/hooks/lib/@DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER@ %REPOS%/hooks/bin/@DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER@_activity.pl %REPOS%/hooks/etc/@DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER@/glue.conf @DEVEL_CONFIG_ACTIVITY_VERIFY@ %REPOS% %TXN% >&2

REM Do not define label @DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER@_script_failed. This will result in the batch
REM file to fail without terminating the command interpreter
if NOT %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 goto @DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER@_script_failed 2>nul
REM
REM
REM @DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME@_STANZA_STOP
