    <para>
      &devel-product-name; is a system that integrates software
      configuration management with bug-tracking. It is implemented in
      Perl and has been successfully deployed on UNIX-like and Windows
      systems. It is pronounced

    <title>Why Use An SCM System?</title>

    <para>
      Those who do not use a software configuration management (SCM)
      system do not maintain a history of modifications performed to
      their software. When bugs creep in their software, they do not
      have adequate information on how changes to source code came
      about.
    </para>

    <para>
      SCM systems, or even simple source code version control systems,
      make sure that a record of all changes and enhancements to the
      software is maintained. They provide a method of creating,
      storing, and labeling software changes.

    <title>Why Use A Bug-tracking System?</title>
                                                                                
    <para>
      Those who do not use a bug-tracking system tend to rely on
      shared lists, email, spreadsheets and/or Post-It notes to
      monitor the status of defects. This procedure is usually
      error-prone and tends to cause those bugs judged least
      significant by developers to be dropped or ignored.
    </para>
                                                                                
    <para>
      Integrated defect-tracking systems make sure that nothing gets
      swept under the carpet; they provide a method of creating,
      storing, arranging and processing defect reports and enhancement
      requests.

    <title>Why Integrate SCM With Bug-tracking?</title>

    <para>
      SCM systems maintain software changes. Bug-tracking systems
      maintain lists of software enhancements and defects. By
      examining a log of software changes, it is uncertain
      <emphasis>why</emphasis> the changes occurred. By examining a log
      of defect reports, it is uncertain <emphasis>what</emphasis>
      changed in software in response to the defects.
    </para>

    <para>
      Integration of SCM with bug-tracking ties the reason
      <emphasis>why</emphasis> a feature/defect was developed/fixed
      with <emphasis>what</emphasis> software changes occurred in the
      SCM system to accomplish this.
