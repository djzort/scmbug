# PRE-COMMIT HOOK
#
# The pre-commit hook is invoked before a Subversion txn is
# committed.  Subversion runs this hook by invoking a program
# (script, executable, binary, etc.) named 'pre-commit' (for which
# this file is a template), with the following ordered arguments:
#
#   [1] REPOS-PATH   (the path to this repository)
#   [2] TXN-NAME     (the name of the txn about to be committed)
#
# The default working directory for the invocation is undefined, so
# the program should set one explicitly if it cares.
#
# If the hook program exits with success, the txn is committed; but
# if it exits with failure (non-zero), the txn is aborted and no
# commit takes place.  The hook program can use the 'svnlook'
# utility to help it examine the txn.
#
# On a Unix system, the normal procedure is to have 'pre-commit'
# invoke other programs to do the real work, though it may do the
# work itself too.
#
#   ***   NOTE: THE HOOK PROGRAM MUST NOT MODIFY THE TXN.    ***
#   This is why we recommend using the read-only 'svnlook' utility.
#   In the future, Subversion may enforce the rule that pre-commit
#   hooks should not modify txns, or else come up with a mechanism
#   to make it safe to do so (by informing the committing client of
#   the changes).  However, right now neither mechanism is
#   implemented, so hook writers just have to be careful.
#
# Note that 'pre-commit' must be executable by the user(s) who will
# invoke it (typically the user httpd runs as), and that user must
# have filesystem-level permission to access the repository.
#
# On a Windows system, you should name the hook program
# 'pre-commit.bat' or 'pre-commit.exe',
# but the basic idea is the same.
#
# Here is an example hook script, for a Unix /bin/sh interpreter:

REPOS="$1"
TXN="$2"

# @DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME@_STANZA_START
#
#
# Call the @DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME@ integration glue
@DEVEL_CONFIG_PERL_BINARY@ -I ${REPOS}/hooks/lib/@DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER@ ${REPOS}/hooks/bin/@DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER@_activity.pl ${REPOS}/hooks/etc/@DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER@/glue.conf @DEVEL_CONFIG_ACTIVITY_VERIFY@ ${REPOS} ${TXN} >&2

exit $?

# @DEVEL_PRODUCT_NAME@_STANZA_STOP
