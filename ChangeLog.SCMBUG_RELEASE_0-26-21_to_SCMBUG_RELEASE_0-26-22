	* src/lib/product/Daemon/Process.pm.in (1.25,
	  SCMBUG_RELEASE_0-26-22): bug 1516: %mail should be set to a
	  reference, not to a hash, because it is treated as a hash
	  reference. This corrects the problem observed by Raghavendra
	  Achar, and has been tested to work.

	* src/lib/product/Daemon/Integration.pm.in (1.42), doc/AUTHORS
	  (1.36) (utags: SCMBUG_RELEASE_0-26-22): bug 1187: Applied a patch
	  by Hans-Emil Skogh that keeps the handling of tag deletions
	  consistent with the handling of tag additions when
	  valid_product_name is disabled. Extended the patch to also log
	  that valid_product_name is enabled on the corresponding code
	  path.

	  Bugzilla 4rc1 issues a:

	  binmode STDERR, ":encoding($encoding)";
