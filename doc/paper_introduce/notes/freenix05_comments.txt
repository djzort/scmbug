Title:   Scmbug: Policy-based Integration of Software Configuration Management with Bug-tracking
Authors: Kristis Makris
Email:   kristis.makris@asu.edu

More descriptive and longer captions for the figures would be helpful. 
Also, for Figures 3 to 5, the text seems to indicate that these are really
just part of one log file. It would be nice to make that clearer in the
figures.

The benefit of a minimum log message size is not clear to me.  It sounds
like it may rather annoy than educate.  It might be better to just print a
warning than to prohibit the commit.

A paragraph or two on how your system effects productivity might be
interesting.  Do the extra validation make life more difficult for the
developers?  Can you measure long term benefits from some the checks that
you enforce?

=======================================================================

The main contribution is the implementation of a Perl-based tool that
combines software configuration management and bug-tracking systems.

The paper is well written, and the problems associated with the design of
such a tool are thoroughly discussed. The related work section points out
that while a slightly different approach is taken, there is no real
innovation. Still, this is very useful software.

The implementation appears to be mature.



=======================================================================

Bug tracking keyed with SW configuration tool is discussed.  
Paper is well written and a topical subject, especially in the open source
community.  Would like to see more about successes and failures that have
been encountered using this tool

=======================================================================

It's a highly relevant subject area, and adds new functionality that
could be extremely useful to many open source projects.  The paper is
well structured, discussing implementation details, practical experience
of the use of the tool, and future design work required to integrate
with SCM tools having different properties.  The tool has been used in
practice and the paper includes observations of how successful it was.
There's discussion of important practical aspects such as security when
you have public commits to an SCM system.
